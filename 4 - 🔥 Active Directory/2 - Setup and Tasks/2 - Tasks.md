# Tasks 

## Usual Tasks : 
• Enumerate the internal network, identifying hosts, critical services, and potential avenues for a foothold.
• This can include active and passive measures to identify users, hosts, and vulnerabilities we may be able to take advantage of to further our access.
• Document any findings we come across for later use. Extremely important!

## Key Data Points :  

1. **AD Users** 
   We are trying to enumerate valid user accounts we can target for password spraying
   
2. **AD Joined Computers**
   Key Computers include Domain Controllers, file servers, SQL servers, web servers, Exchange mail servers, database servers, etc.
   
3. **Key Services**
   Kerberos, NetBIOS, LDAP, DNS
   
4. **Vulnerable Hosts and Services**
   Anything that can be a quick win. ( a.k.a an easy host to exploit and gain a foothold)
