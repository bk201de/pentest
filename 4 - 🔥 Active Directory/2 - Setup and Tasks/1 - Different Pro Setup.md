# Different Professional Setup 

• A penetration testing distro (typically Linux) as a virtual machine in their internal infrastructure that calls back to a jump host we control over VPN, and we can SSH into.
• A physical device plugged into an ethernet port that calls back to us over VPN, and we can SSH into.
• A physical presence at their office with our laptop plugged into an ethernet port.
• A Linux VM in either Azure or AWS with access to the internal network that we can SSH into using public key authentication and our public IP address whitelisted.
• VPN access into their internal network (a bit limiting because we will not be able to perform certain attacks such as LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning).
• From a corporate laptop connected to the client's VPN.
• On a managed workstation (typically Windows), physically sitting in their office with limited or no internet access or ability to pull in tools. They may also elect this option but give you full internet access, local admin, and put endpoint protection into monitor mode so you can pull in tools at will.
• On a VDI (virtual desktop) accessed using Citrix or the like, with one of the configurations described for the managed workstation typically accessible over VPN either remotely or from a corporate laptop.
