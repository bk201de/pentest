# OID Brute Force

Once we know the community strings, we can use this to brute force the OIDs and enumerate the info behind them.   

Install Braa:  
```bash
sudo apt install braa
```

Execute:  
```bash
braa public@10.10.10.10:.1.3.6.*
```

And after that, you can use `snmpwalk` to determine each:  
```bash
snmpwalk -c public -v1 10.0.0.1 1.3.6.xxxxxxxx
```
