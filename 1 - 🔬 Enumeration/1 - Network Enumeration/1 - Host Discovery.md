# Host Discovery


## Method 1:
Using **ICMP echo request** :   
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
```

Notes:  
`-sn` : disables the port scan
`10.129.2.0/24` : the target IP range
`-oA` : stores the result in all formats

Notes:
*This will only work if the firewall allows it. Otherwise, we need to bypass the firewall.*


## Method 2:
Use a file that has a list of IP addresses to see what is alive:
```bash
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
```

Notes:
`-iL` : Perform defined check for the IP addresses inside the `hosts.lst`
