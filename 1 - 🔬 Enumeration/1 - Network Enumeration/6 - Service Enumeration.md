# Service Enumeration

Tip:
*Identify first all of the ports and then do service enumeration for specific ports found to save time.*

```bash
nmap -sV -p 22,80,139,31337 10.129.2.28 -Pn
```

Note:
You can use Threader3000 to get all of the ports quickly within few seconds. After that, do the commands above to scan for the specified ports.
