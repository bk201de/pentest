# Trace the Packets

To have a better view of the specific scan:   

```bash
sudo nmap 192.129.2.28 -p 21 --packet-trace -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping
```

Notes:
`--packet-trace` : to track the activities that NMap did 
`-Pn` : for us to track the flow, we deactivated the ICMP echo request
`-n` : deactivated the DNS resolution for the same reasons as -Pn
`--disable-arp-ping` : deactivated the ARP ping scan for the same reason as -Pn

## Reason

We can add the flag `--reason` to see the explanation of the results.
