# Scan Top Ports

Notes:  
- By default, it scan the top 1000 common TCP ports
- If you didn't set any scanning flag as sudo, it will have the `-sS`
- If you didn't set any scanning flag without sudo, it will have the `-sT`

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 --top-ports=10
```

Notes:  
`--top-ports=10` : means it will scan the top 10 common ports
