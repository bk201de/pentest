# Connection

Here are some of the explanation what happens in the background:

1. NMap will send a `SYN` packet to the target and wait
2. It is `open` if the target responds with `SYN-ACK`
3. It is `closed` if the target responds with `RST`
4. It is `filtered` if the target has no response or we get an error (*might be a firewall*)
